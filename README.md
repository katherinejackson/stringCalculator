# stringCalculator

Simple string calculator that can read a string and add the numbers found.

String can be separated by a comma (Ex: "1, 2, 3" would return 6).  Or strings can have a custom deliminator and be in the form "//[delimiter]\n[delimiter separated numbers]" (ex: "//@\n2@3@8" would return 13). 
Negative numbers will cause an exception.
